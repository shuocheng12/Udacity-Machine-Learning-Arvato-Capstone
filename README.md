# Capstone Project #

*Udacity - Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program*

## Project Overview ##

This project is to aid a mail-order sales company to acquire new German clients for their mail-out campaign based on analyzing and comparing the attributes of general population and potential target Germen population. The end goal is to identify and predict a group of target audience of the campaign that could bring the highest return for the company. This study would point out a general direction for the company to move forward with higher return on investment.

# Software and Libraries #

This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended that you use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

- NumPy
- pandas
- pickle
- Sklearn / scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Seaborn (for data visualization)

## How the project is organized ##

#### File Descriptions:

**`proposal.pdf`:** Summarize the intent and initial blueprint of the project

**`report.pdf:`** Summarize the findings and analysis of the project

**`Arvato_capstone.ipynb`:** Jupyter Notebook that runs in the following three segments:

0. Data Cleaning and Transformation//
1. Unsupervised Learning//
2. Supervised Learning//

**`Kaggle_submission.ipynb:`** Jupyter Notebook for final submission amendments and testing more models

**`README.md`:** This file, describing the contents of the project

**`DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx`:** Explaining the features of the data headers

**`Materials` folder:** Images and Tables used for the final report

**The notebooks expect that the following files are present in the `data` folder:**

- `Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv`
- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv`
- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv`
- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv`

**The data is the property of Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics and it is not included in the repository.**

Also `AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv` is expected to be present in the `data` folder. This file is constructed for this project and contains only metadata (the file is provided)
